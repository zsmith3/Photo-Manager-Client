# Introduction

This project has three main goals:
- To provide a powerful photo management system (like, for example, Picasa)
- To allow for connection to a self-hosted file server
- To be open source

Example use case: I want to be able to remotely synchronise the photos on my phone and my computer, and organise them on either one. But, I don't want the cost/privacy issues of uploading to a third-party site.

# Demo

This site also contains a [live working demo](./demo/) of the project in its current state. I've added a small set of sample images to play around with. You will need to create an account to log in, and can use this account token: "74d66d41c7b02b560c5d6d93c66783e13cd5701c19f761162deb0d9adf9bbe5c".
